### RestShell Script ###
###
### Personal project to make a series of Rest Requests using Powershell.
### The idea being to make Rest Requests available to the layman while simplifying dev work.
###
### Open this file in Powershell ISE to leverage the other scripts in this directory
### By Default, this script will call up the command line menu that shows the different available files and scripts to run.

.\menu.ps1


### For those who hack

# If you know already which request file to open and run, uncomment this line and comment the .\menu.ps1 line and provide the filename of your JSON file
# .\InvokeRequest.ps1 -TargetRequestFile .\my_local_file.json
